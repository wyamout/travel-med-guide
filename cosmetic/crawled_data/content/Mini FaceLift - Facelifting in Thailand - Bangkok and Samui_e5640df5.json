The surgeon will begin with making incisions in front of the ear, inside the hairline at the temple.",
      "At this time extra skin is removed and the tightening of the sagging muscles and connective tissues are done. There are some cases, in which, fatty deposits are also removed from under the chin and the neck. Afterwards, the incisions are closed with small sutures.
