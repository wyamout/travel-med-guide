      "A perfectly sculpted body that is able to carry of any fashionable outfit, particularly a little string bikini for a day at the beach is something sought after the world over. Exercise and diet play a major role, but for some cellulite and a genetic predisposition to fatty deposits in areas like the thighs, arms, stomach and buttocks is unavoidable. Liposuction in Thailand is an ideal answer to those who wish to sculpt their bodies to be bikini beautiful.",
      "Liposuction is a procedure that removes excess fatty tissue and cellulite from problematic areas in the body and the treatment can be administered to correct problem areas where excess fat is stored in the body. It can smooth the lumpy appearance of thighs, can sculpt the stomach and buttocks, the waist and arms and can even be used to minimise a double chin.",

      "Excessive liposuction, where too much fatty tissue is removed at once can result in toxicity and in the patients skin having an uneven and even lumpy appearance. This can be associated with nausea, vomiting, excessive pain, bruising, swelling, slow wound healing, skin irregularities and depressions, blood clots and injury to abdominal organs.",
      "The patient can be discharged between 1 – 3 hours after the procedure and there is usually no need for them remain in hospital overnight.",
