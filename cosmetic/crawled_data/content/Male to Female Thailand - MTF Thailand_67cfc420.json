      "Once you have made that decision to go from male to female, and have gone through all the required steps the next step that you have to take is sex reassignment. When you’re ready to take this you should consider male to female Thailand. You’ll be able to get away and concentrate on what your goal is and recovery in peace in a beautiful country and return home as a new person. However, before you start making the plans to travel to Thailand there are some things that you should be aware of.",
      "If you want to undergo male to female Thailand then you have to meet the requirement of being 18 years of age or older. If you’re under the age of 20, you have to have the permission from your parents.   In addition, you have to be diagnosed with either gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or another disorder, such as anxiety or depression.  You must have also undergone one year at least or antiandrogens  and/or hormones. I",
      "It’s required that you have lived in the cross-gender role for at least one year full-time.  Lastly, you must have the approval from a clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker or from a psychiatrist.  Once you have met of the requirements you’re ready for the surgery. The surgery involves a combination of  penile skin inversion as well as an immediate full thickness skin graft. The vaginal canal and the opening is created underneath the urethral opening and prostate gland.",
      "Since vaginal depth is the biggest concern for most people, you should keep in mind that the factor in creating the depth is the amount of penile shaft skin.  The method for male to female Thailand that lengthens the vaginas depth is using the full thickness of the skin graft from the scrotal.  The hair that’s on the scrotum is removed so the skin graft is placed at the distal end of the penile skin flap.",
      "By using this method it can lengthen the depth 2 more inches at least.  The operation will last about 3 hours. Before being released from the hospital to the hotel, there’ll be a nurse to explain how to care for the vagina as well as prescribe more medication. In 7-10 days the stitches will be removed, and you can return home.   The neovagina will be functional within 6 weeks after.",
      "As mentioned, 6 weeks after the male to female Thailand you’re able to engage in neovaginal intercourse. There is some virginal lubrication during sexual arousal, however, you should apply lubricant jelly at the opening of the vagina before intercourse. It’s typical, during arousal that there’ll be mild swelling of the urethral meatus which can be corrected with cosmetic improvement.",
      "So when you have male to female Thailand you’ll afterwards be able to function as a women. Since you’re Thailand you’ll be able to fully recover and have some new experiences as well as learn about a new culture.  When you’re entirely recovered from the surgery you’ll be able to go back home and start a new life.",
