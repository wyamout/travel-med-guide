      "The nose is an important part of the face. It can either make or break the beauty of a face. If the nose isn’t in proportion with the other features of the face sometimes it can throw off the face’s whole look. Nose surgery Thailand, rhinoplasty, which comes from the Greek word Rhinos- “nose” and Plastikos- “to shape” is a procedure that’s performed either by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, ENT surgeon or a plastic surgeon to improve the look and/or the function of the nose.",
      "A rhinoplasty is normally, preformed to create a better visual or for the purpose of reconstructing to correct defects from birth or problems with breathing. Nose surgery Thailand can be preformed, in addition, to other surgeries such as chin lifts that will result in a better appearance. Depending on what your requirements are you can either increase or decrease the size of your nose.",
      "You can also narrow the nostril spans, alter the angle between the upper lip and the nose, and/or alter the bridge or the tip of the nose, and as motioned above may be able to correct breathing problems. If the rhinoplasty is simple, then normally the surgery can be preformed as an outpatient surgery or the surgery can take place in the surgeon’s office.",
      "Nose surgery Thailand, the majority of the times only take about an hour or two, and you’ll be able to go home almost immediately. If you’re nose job is more complicated then the procedure may have to be done in the hospital and require you have a short stay. The procedure is preformed by a surgeon that has advanced training in both plastic and reconstructive surgery.",
      "Involved with the rhinoplasty, is the re-sculpting of cartilage and the bone. The nose, when it’s operated on by surgeons can choose to either work from inside the nose by making an incision inside the nose, or work from the outside, which requires making a small incision across the tissue that divides the nostrils. This procedure is known as an “open” process.",
      "There are some cases in which nose surgery Thailand, where the surgeon might shape a small piece of a person’s cartilage or bone to increase or strengthen the nose’s structure. This can sometimes be done fore cosmetic reasons , such as to improve shape of the nasal tip or on the other hand, it can be preformed to improve the function of the nose and breathing. You can recovery from the surgery in a few days, and you can return to work/school normally within a week. Your surgeon will inform you about when you can return to your normal activities.",
      "Just as with any surgery you’ll have there are short term side effects, such as in the first few days a small amount of bleeding, puffy face, nose ache, headache, swelling surrounding the eyes and small burst blood vessels that appear as tiny red spots on skin’s surface. There will also be a splint placed on the nose as to make sure that the new shape is maintained. When you finished with nose surgery Thailand you’ll be pleased with the results.",
