      "The nose is among one of the important features that are on faces. So the shape and the size of the nose is very vital to your overall appearance and the confidence and self-esteem that you have for yourself. If you have a nose that you would like to make some alterations to then you should consider nose implant Thailand.",
      "If you have the desire to change the appearance of your nose by either increasing the bridge of the nose or shaping in such a way that you have a nose that’s more defined then there are nose implant Thailand surgeries that can be preformed to make your wish come true. So start making plans to come to Thailand and get the nose that you always wanted. In addition, you can also have a little vacation.",
      "When you schedule your procedure and travel to Thailand it’s suggested that you plan to stay 14 days at least so the entire process can be complete. One day that you arrive to Thailand, it would be ideal to have a relaxing night in a comfortable hotel after the long flight so that way you can be prepared for the surgery the next day.",
      "The reshaping of the nose requires that you stay one night in the hospital, however, the implant is preformed as an outpatient basis. There are also a post operative check up as well as the removal of stitches that will occur on day seven after the surgery. So what’s the surgery all about?",
      "When you get a nose implant Thailand, the surgeon will place the silicone on the nose’s bridge by making an incision that’s about one centimeters at the sides of the nostrils. Then there’s a pocket that’s made along the ridge of the nose cartilage where the silicone is inserted into.",
      "For the reshaping of the nose, the cuts are placed inside the nose so they’re hidden. Through the incisions, soft tissues that cover the nose are lifted gently which allows for the structure of nose to be reshaped. For the reshaping of the nose, you’ll be put under general anesthesia. On the other hand, for the nose implant the surgery is preformed with local anesthesia.",
      "Once you have the surgery, there will be cold compresses applied on the nose for 2-3 days and you’ll not be allowed to sleep on flat on the face. The bleeding that you’ll experienced will stop after the first day of the surgery. 14 days after nose implant Thailand you should avoid doing any strenuous activities so there won’t be any increased swelling. After 3 months the swelling will settle and the will be completely healed. If you’re worried about the scars keep in mind that the scars will be inside the nose.",
      "As with any surgery that you have preformed, nose implant Thailand include risk, such as bruising, swelling, bleeding, scaring, infection and numbness. However, these risk can be greatly reduced if you make sure to follow the surgeon’s directions.",
