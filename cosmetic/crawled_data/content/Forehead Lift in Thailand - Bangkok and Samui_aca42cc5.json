      "For women and men both aging can be a difficult process to go through, therefore, many people go have all sorts of creams and other rituals to make their face look like it did in their younger days. However, sometimes this is not enough so they, instead, decide to have a full facelift.",
      "A full faceliftis suggested for people who are over the age of 40 and are displaying signs of aging. The procedure removes extra skin and then the underlying muscles are tightened. This surgery will help in restoring the skin of the face as well as the neck. When you choose to have this procedure preformed, you’ll also have a mid-facelift, neck lift as well as a forehead lift.",
      "When you come to Thailand for your procedure you should be expect to stay for 10-14 days at least, of course, you can also stay longer and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Once you arrive in Thailand, you should relax in a hotel after the long flight and then have the surgery the next day. For the facelift you’ll be required to stay four nights in the hospital, and the post operative check-up and stitches will removed after 7-10 days.",
      "The procedure takes 3-4 hours on average and is preformed under general anesthesia. The incision is made above the hairline, in the temple area and is brought in to the front of the ear and then loops behind the ear lobe and along the lower scalp. The face and the neck will be tightened together and the placement of the cuts will be determined by the examination of the structure of the face. During the full faceliftthe patient can also choose to have chin liposuction so the result of the procedure can be enhanced.",
      "Once the surgery is completed, you’ll have to use a cold compress for two days, and avoid lying in such a way that the cheeks come into contact with either the pillows are the bed for a month to prevent formation of hematomas. There may be some numbness that may occur for 3-6 months and you should keep from doing any activities that are strenuous for 4-6 weeks after the surgery.",
      "This will ensure that your body will have more than enough time to adjust to the full faceliftas it continues to heal. The scars are normally hidden by the hairline or either in the natural creases in the ears and face. The scars will fade and barley be visible. So there’s no need to worry about the scars after the surgery.",
      "As mentioned above you’ll be required to stay in Thailand for your full faceliftfor at least 10-14 days, however, you can stay longer and enjoy a vacation while you’re here. Thailand is a beautiful country and has lot to see and offer. So while you’re here giving yourself your lift why not give yourself the experience of a new culture and try some different things and go home refreshed.",
