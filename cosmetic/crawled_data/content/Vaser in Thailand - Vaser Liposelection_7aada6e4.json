      "Vaser liposuction Thailand or LipoSelection Thailand as it is also known, is a form of cosmetic surgery that is designed to remove build ups of excess fact from the skin leaving firmer, younger body shape. It is designed to target specific areas that are mostly unaffected by diet and exercise. It is just one of several innovative approaches to removing the fat with great results..",
      "Vaser Lipo uses ultrasonic energy to selectively break down fat deposits for easy and safe removal. As it is a minimally invasive procedure with success rates, the procedure has become very popular for men and women. Vaser Liposuction can be used to remove fat from nearly all parts of the body except the face and other sensitive areas. Vaser Lipo surgery is perfect for everything from minor adjustments to major changes. Moreover, VASER can be used for areas of the body re-sculpting to make them appear more toned and muscular",
      "While technology and equipment have been constantly improved, ultrasonic energy is used to break up fat deposits has been used for a number of years. The beauty of this is that you can be safe in the knowledge that the surgeons were exposed to the different techniques proposed. The energy that is used in Vaser Liposuction is tissue selective, which means that the ultrasound energy targets unwanted fat, but preserves other surrounding tissues such as nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue, promote smooth contours and reduce healing time. Therefore, liposuction surgery vaser provides a faster and improved surgery healing time.",
      "The surgeon begins the operation by making a small incision in the selected area. The fat layer is then infused with tumescent fluid. A small probe, which transmits ultrasonic energy is then inserted. The probe is used to selectively break the stubborn fat cells and emulsify into the liquid infusion. The emulsified fat is then removed using a specially designed suction cannula VentX.",
      "As the procedure only requires a small incision and no physical force whatsoever, the payback period is much shorter than traditional liposuction. Moreover, no suturing or sewing is necessary, therefore, during the healing process, the skin retracts seamlessly to give firmer looking, smoother and more natural feel. However, some scars are inevitable. Patients can expect to resume their normal activities within 1-2 weeks, depending on the area treated and amount of fat removed.",
      "In addition to a reduced recovery period, Vaser liposuction also has a number of other advantages over other forms of fat removal. Vaser Lipo surgery is performed under local anesthesia, so there is usually no need for an overnight stay, the risks are as small as it is not an invasive surgery, more fat can be removed at a time and the overall benefits are remarkable.",
