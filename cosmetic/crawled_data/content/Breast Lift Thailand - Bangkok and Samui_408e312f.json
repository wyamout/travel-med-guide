      "Sometimes without even realizing it the aging process starts to take hold and parts of the body that use to sit up high or sitting low and some areas of the body are widening out and dropping. There’s not a whole lot that can be done without the intervention of surgery so many women decide that once their breast begin to sag whether it’s due to aging or other life happening the solution for this problem is breast lift Thailand.",
      "There are various ways that breast lift Thailandcan be preformed. However, the most common technique involves an anchor-shaped incision, which follows the natural contour of the breast. Where the cut is made, the incision outlines the sections which the skin from the breast is removed and then creates a new locale for the nipple.",
      "When the extra skin is removes, then the nipple and the areola are moved to a higher position. The skin that surrounds the areola is brought down together, in order, to reshape the breast. Normally, there are stitches that are placed around the areola in a straight vertical line that extends from the area of the nipple and along the lower fold of the breast.",
      "There are some patients who opt for breast lift Thailand, especially for the women that have breast that are small and have sagging that is minimal, might be a candidate for a modifies procedure that has the requirement of less incisions. For instance, the procedure is done in a “doughnut or concentric mastopexy”, which are circular incisions that are made around the area of the areola. There’s also a doughnut shaped area of shin that’s removed.",
      "If there’s a patient that’s having implants as well during the breast lift, then the surgeon will place it in the pocket that is directly underneath the breast tissue, or either deeper under the chest wall muscle. During the surgery, the surgeon will make the effort to ensure that the scars left from the breast as unnoticeable as possible. Although, the surgeon will do his best it’s best to remember that mastopexy scars are permanent and extensive.",
      "Your breast may remain red and lumpy for a few months, and over time it’ll become less noticeable, and may even fade into white thin lines. Happily, the surgeon can make the incisions in an area in which it cannot be seen and you’ll even be able to wear tops that are low cut after breast lift Thailand.It’s important to keep close in mind that while the risk are low for complications are low you still need to be aware of them.",
      "The possible risk for breast lift Thailandare separated into two groups. The first group, which are the main risk, include bruising, swelling, infection, scar, numbness and bleeding. In the second group, which are specific for the breast lift procedure, is damage to the supply of blood to the nipple and a thick scar. In addition, breast feeding may not be a possibility. Another, important thing to note is that breast lift doesn’t increase the risk of breast reduction, but the risk may even slightly decline.",
