      "The eyes speak volumes to those that come into contact with us. They often can tell others how a person feels, and when they have bags under the eyes it can often say that they’re overworking, tired or the aging process is starting to take hold. For this reason, many decide that they want to change what their eyes says about them and opt to have lower eyelid surgery.",
      "The traditional lower eyelid surgery is preformed by an incision being made just underneath the line of the lash. Extra fat, skin and muscle are removed and surgeons use fine sutures to close up the incision. The permanent stitches are removed after 3-5 days.",
      "If there’s a pocket of fat underneath the lower eyelids, but don’t require the need to have loose skin removed, it may be suggested that you have a transconjunctival blepharoplasty. During this procedure there’s are incision made on the inside of the lower eyelid, which will not leave a visible scar. This surgery is, normally, preformed on younger patients that have fatty lower eyelids. This procedure doesn’t tighten the skin, but instead, decreases the puffiness that’s in the lower lid area.",
      "Before you have the lower eyelid surgery it’s important that you inform the surgeon about any allergies that you have, in addition, to any medical conditions that are serious, and the medications that you are on including non-prescription medications you may be using.",
      "When you get to Thailand, depending on your surgeons as well as your preferences, but the surgery can either be preformed on an outpatient basis or in the hospital or in an ambulatory suite. The surgeon can choose to use local or general anesthesia for performing the surgery. After, the first evening of the surgery you’ll be required to rest quietly and with your head elevated.",
      "A huge help will be to place cold compresses to the eyelids. Your blood pressure will be monitored as to avoid bleeding complications that may affect your vision. Though, you can be up and moving around almost right away, you should have limited activities.",
      "After, you have the lower eyelid surgery you’ll notice that you’ll have larger and more brighter eyes as well as more rested since the loose skin, stretched muscle and extra fat have been removed. Since the skin of the upper eyelid have been removed, which hang down and cause issues with peripheral vision, some people experience improved vision. Of course, the eyes will look more youthful, which is the whole goal of the surgery.",
      "The lower eyelid surgery most likely will smooth out the bulges and remove the bags from underneath the eyes, and cause the skin to be snugger. After the surgery, you’ll no longer look tired and in need in rest and when others look at you they will not be focusing on your lower lids, but think about how great and well-rested you look. The results of this surgery are last longing. So if you’re between the ages of 38 and 50 and want to get rid of your bags then this surgery is ideal for you.",
