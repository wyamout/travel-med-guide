      "If you want to improve and enhance yourself so you can have a even more younger looking appearance, in addition, to the lower eyelid surgery, you should also consider having upper eyelid surgery while you’re in Thailand.",
      "During this procedure there’s an incision made along the natural fold of the skin. The upper eyelid surgery removes extra skin and fatty tissue, and then the muscles and the orbital septum can be tightened. The incisions are then closed up carefully. The majority of the surgery is preformed with a very fine eletrocatuery, which controls bleeding if it occurs. Afterwards, very fine stitches are used to close the skin.",
      "When you get to Thailand and have a consultation with your surgeon it’s important that you inform them of any allergies that you may have, serious medical issues you’re dealing with, and medications you’re taking, whether they’re non-prescription or prescription drugs. You should also avoid taking aspirin and any other drugs that might contain aspirin two weeks before you have the surgery.",
      "You and your surgeon will discuss this, but you can either decide to have the upper eyelid surgeryas an outpatient procedure or conducted in the hospital preformed under local or general anesthesia. The surgery can take one hour. Once the surgery is done, your eyes will be lubricated with an ointment and a bandaged may be applied by your surgeon.",
      "There’s a chance that your eyelids may have a tight feeling as the anesthesia begins to wear off, however, any discomfort that you might be feeling will be controlled with pain medication. Of course, you should call your surgeon if the pain is severe.",
      "For several days, your surgeon will require that you keep your head elevated as well as use cold compresses to decrease bruising and swelling. The bruising that you’ll experience will vary since every person is different. During the first week, the bruising will reach it’s peak and will, normally last for two weeks to a month.",
      "You’ll also be shown how to clean your eyes, which you may find gummy for at least a week. Since your eyelids may feel dry, burn and itch there are some doctors that’ll suggest using eye drops. For the first, few weeks after the upper eyelid surgerythere’s a chance that you experience extreme lachrmosity (crying), light sensitivity, and temporary eyesight changes, such as double vision.",
      "To make sure everything is progressing smoothly, for the first two weeks or so the surgeon will closely follow your progress. Two days to a week after the surgery the stitches will be removed, and once they are the swelling and discoloration surrounding the eyes will steadily decrease. The you’ll begin to feel like yourself, but only feel and look even better. You’ll notice that the upper eyelid surgery will cause a dramatic change in your face’s appearance, alleviating the look of old age and tiredness. You’ll be glad to see that your eyes will appear more youthful and fresher.",
