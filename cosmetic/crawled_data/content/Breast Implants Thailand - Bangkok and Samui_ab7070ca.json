      "For any woman breasts are an important feature so since this is the case, the majority of women that don’t have breast large enough to their satisfaction so they’ll take the necessary steps to change their situation. They may do different things to make their breast look larger, but ultimately they come to the conclusion that it’s not just enough so many start to look into enlarging their breast and decide to go for breast implants Thailand.",
      "Thailand is the prefect place to go if you desire to have larger breast. The surgeons in Thailand will ensure that you’ll get the best results possible, however, it’s important that you be realistic in your expectations when considering breast implants Thailand. As long as you have expectations that are realistic then you’ll most likely be happy with the results. So before you have consultation, what should you know?",
      "The first, thing that you have to keep in mind is that this procedure is preformed once the breast have reached their final size, which is after puberty (17-18 years of age). The only exception to this is in cases of breast asymmetry or congenital breast hyperplasia then the procedure can be preformed earlier.",
      "When you decide on breast implants Thailandyou have to consider three possible areas in which the implant can be placed. The first, possibility and most common is to insert it in the lower fold of the breast. This enables the surgeon full excess and the scar is hidden in this area. The second, possibility is through the areola. Making an incision in this area provides the best results and it as well is the only method that goes through the breast tissue. This means that there may be a risk of infection, in addition, to loss of sensation is higher.",
      "The last, possible area for the incision is through the armpits. There are some plastic surgeons that prefer this method because the scar that’s created is virtually invisible, unless, of course, if you wear sleeveless tops. The one disadvantage that may come with this incision is slight asymmetry of the breast. However, you and the surgeon will make the final decision as to what incision method is right for you.Another, important thing that you have to make a decision about is what shape of implants you’d like to have. There are two different shapes that you can choose from. The first, is a round shape and the other is pear shaped, which is also called “anatomic implants” since the shape is similar to the contour of a natural breast. However, these are more expensive and a larger incision is required during the surgery. So this is a matter that you have to think carefully about when going through breast implants Thailand.",
      "After, the surgery you’ll be required to wear a bandage or a sports bra at all times for a month. Once three months have passed after the surgery, optimal results can normally be seen after you finish with your breast implants Thailand.",
