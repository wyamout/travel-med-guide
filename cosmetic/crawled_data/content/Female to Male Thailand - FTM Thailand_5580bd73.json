      "After the surgery is completed,  you should be aware of the fact that there’ll be no sensation in the penis, the urine flow might leak, which will require many correction surgeries and most importantly the appearance of the penis will not 100% look like a male. All these things you should consider before undergoing female to male Thailand.  Before you are released from the hospital to go to your hotel the nurse you show how to take care of yourself and prescribe some medication.  In 7-10 days the stitches are removed and you’re all set to go home.",
