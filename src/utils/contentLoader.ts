    h1Title: "Alarplasty Surgery in Thailand",
    paragraphs: [
      "Alarplasty, also known as alar base reduction or nostril reduction surgery, is a precise cosmetic procedure that narrows the width of the nostrils and reduces the flare of the nasal base. For patients who feel their nostrils are disproportionately wide relative to the rest of their nose or face, alarplasty offers a targeted solution with natural-looking results. Thailand has become one of the most sought-after destinations for this procedure, combining board-certified plastic surgeons with internationally accredited hospital facilities at a fraction of Western prices.",
      "The procedure is performed by making small, carefully placed incisions at the base of the nostrils, typically within the natural crease where the nostril meets the cheek. This strategic placement ensures that any resulting scars are virtually invisible once fully healed. Depending on your anatomy and goals, your surgeon may use a wedge excision technique to remove a small section of tissue from the nostril floor, or a sill excision to narrow the base without changing the nostril shape. In some cases, both techniques are combined for optimal results.",
      "Ideal candidates for alarplasty are individuals in good overall health who are bothered by wide or flared nostrils. The procedure is commonly performed as a standalone surgery but is frequently combined with rhinoplasty for patients seeking comprehensive nasal reshaping. During your initial consultation, your surgeon will evaluate your nasal anatomy, discuss your aesthetic goals, and use digital imaging to help you visualise the expected outcome. This thorough pre-operative assessment is a hallmark of Thailand's patient-centred approach to cosmetic surgery.",
      "Alarplasty is typically performed under local anaesthesia with sedation and takes between one and two hours. It is usually an outpatient procedure, meaning you can return to your hotel or recovery accommodation the same day. Post-operative discomfort is generally mild and easily managed with prescribed pain medication. You can expect swelling and bruising around the nostrils for the first week, with the majority of visible swelling resolving within two to three weeks.",
      "Stitches are usually removed after seven days, at which point most patients feel comfortable returning to light social activities. Strenuous exercise and activities that risk impact to the nose should be avoided for at least four weeks. It is important to sleep with your head elevated for the first few nights to minimise swelling. Your surgeon will provide detailed aftercare instructions and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your healing progress.",
      "Thailand's JCI-accredited hospitals — including Bumrungrad International, Yanhee International, and Bangkok Hospital — maintain the same rigorous safety and hygiene standards as leading Western medical centres. All surgical teams include board-certified plastic surgeons with extensive training in facial procedures, supported by qualified anaesthesiologists and experienced nursing staff. Patients receive personalised care from dedicated English-speaking coordinators who manage every aspect of the surgical journey, from airport transfers to post-operative check-ups.",
      "Choosing Thailand for alarplasty typically saves international patients 60–70% compared to equivalent procedures in the United States, United Kingdom, or Australia, without any compromise on quality. The cost includes surgeon fees, hospital charges, anaesthesia, post-operative medications, and follow-up consultations. Many patients combine their surgical trip with a recovery holiday, enjoying Thailand's world-renowned hospitality, wellness spas, and tropical scenery during the healing period.",
      "Final results from alarplasty are permanent and typically fully visible within three to six months as all residual swelling resolves. The outcome is a more refined, proportionate nose that harmonises naturally with your other facial features. Patient satisfaction rates for alarplasty in Thailand are consistently high, reflecting both the surgical expertise available and the comprehensive, supportive care that international patients receive throughout their experience."

    paragraphs: [
      "Rhinoplasty — commonly known as a nose job — is one of the most frequently performed cosmetic procedures worldwide, and Thailand has earned an outstanding international reputation for delivering exceptional results. Whether you wish to refine the tip, straighten the bridge, reduce overall size, correct asymmetry, or improve breathing function, Thailand's board-certified plastic surgeons offer the full spectrum of rhinoplasty techniques tailored to your unique facial anatomy and aesthetic goals.",
      "Two primary approaches are used: open rhinoplasty, where a small incision is made on the columella (the tissue between the nostrils), and closed rhinoplasty, where all incisions are hidden inside the nose. Open rhinoplasty provides the surgeon with greater visibility and precision, making it ideal for complex reshaping. Closed rhinoplasty offers faster recovery and no external scarring. Your surgeon will recommend the best approach during your consultation based on the complexity of the changes desired.",
      "During the procedure, the surgeon carefully reshapes the nasal cartilage and bone to achieve the agreed-upon aesthetic outcome. This may involve removing a dorsal hump, narrowing a wide nasal bridge, refining a bulbous tip, adjusting nostril size, or correcting a deviated septum that impairs breathing. Thailand's top rhinoplasty surgeons are trained in both cosmetic and functional nasal surgery, ensuring that form and function are addressed simultaneously.",
      "Rhinoplasty is performed under general anaesthesia and typically takes two to three hours, depending on complexity. Most patients stay one night in the hospital for observation. A nasal splint is placed on the nose to support the new shape during the initial healing phase and is removed after one week. Internal splints or packing, if used, are also removed within the first week.",
      "Post-operative swelling and bruising around the eyes and nose are normal and gradually subside over the following two to four weeks. While the nose will look noticeably improved within the first month, the final, refined result continues to emerge over 12 to 18 months as subtle residual swelling resolves, particularly at the nasal tip. Patients are advised to avoid wearing glasses resting on the bridge of the nose for six weeks and to protect the nose from sun exposure and physical impact during the healing period.",
      "Thailand is home to some of Asia's most experienced rhinoplasty surgeons, many of whom have trained at leading institutions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. Hospitals like Bumrungrad International Hospital and Yanhee International Hospital hold JCI accreditation — the gold standard in international healthcare — ensuring patient safety protocols meet the highest global benchmarks.",
      "International patients choosing rhinoplasty in Thailand typically save 60–70% compared to prices in the US, UK, or Australia. The all-inclusive package usually covers the surgeon's fee, hospital stay, anaesthesia, post-operative medications, and follow-up visits. Combined with Thailand's exceptional hospitality, comfortable recovery facilities, and the opportunity to recuperate in a tropical setting, it is easy to see why thousands of medical tourists choose Thailand for rhinoplasty each year.",
      "A thorough consultation is the foundation of a successful rhinoplasty. During your initial assessment — which can be conducted remotely via video call or in person at the hospital — your surgeon will examine your nasal structure, discuss your goals, review your medical history, and use computer imaging to illustrate potential outcomes. This collaborative approach ensures realistic expectations and a surgical plan that is customised to deliver the most natural, harmonious result for your face."

Whether you are looking to enhance breast volume, restore fullness lost after pregnancy or weight loss, or achieve better symmetry, Thailand's board-certified plastic surgeons work with the latest implant technology from globally trusted brands including Mentor, Motiva, and Allergan.",
      "During your initial consultation, your surgeon will conduct a thorough physical examination and discuss your desired size, shape, and overall aesthetic goals. Key decisions include the type of implant (silicone gel, cohesive gel, or structured), shape (round or anatomical/teardrop), surface texture (smooth or textured), and projection profile (low, moderate, or high). Your surgeon will use sizers during the consultation to help you visualise and feel different options, ensuring you are confident in your choice before surgery.",
      "Three primary incision locations are used for breast augmentation: inframammary (in the natural crease beneath the breast), periareolar (around the lower edge of the areola), and transaxillary (through the armpit). Each approach has specific advantages, and your surgeon will recommend the optimal option based on your anatomy and implant choice. Implant placement is either subglandular (above the chest muscle) or submuscular (partially or fully beneath the pectoral muscle), with submuscular placement being the most common choice as it offers a more natural appearance and reduced risk of capsular contracture.",
      "The surgery is performed under general anaesthesia and typically takes two to three hours. Most patients stay one night in the hospital for observation and monitoring. You will wake up wearing a surgical support bra or compression garment, which should be worn continuously for four to six weeks to support healing and help the implants settle into their final position.",
      "Post-operative recovery involves some tightness, swelling, and mild discomfort for the first week, which is well managed with prescribed pain medication. Most patients feel comfortable returning to desk work and light daily activities within one week. Strenuous upper-body exercise, heavy lifting, and vigorous physical activity should be avoided for at least six weeks. Your implants will gradually settle into a more natural position — a process known as 'drop and fluff' — over three to six months.",
      "Thailand's leading hospitals for breast augmentation, including Bumrungrad International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital, and Yanhee International Hospital, hold JCI accreditation and maintain surgical safety standards equivalent to the world's best medical centres. Operating theatres are equipped with advanced monitoring technology, and all procedures are overseen by certified anaesthesiologists. Post-operative care includes regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon to monitor healing and implant positioning.",
      "The cost of breast augmentation in Thailand is typically 60–70% less than in the United States, United Kingdom, or Australia. A comprehensive package generally includes the surgeon's fee, hospital stay, premium implants (with manufacturer warranty), anaesthesia, post-operative medications, surgical garments, and follow-up consultations. This transparent pricing structure, combined with no hidden fees, is one of the key reasons medical tourists choose Thailand.",
      "Patient safety is the top priority at all partnered hospitals. All implants used are FDA-approved and CE-marked, with full traceability and manufacturer warranty. Your surgeon will provide an implant identification card with serial numbers, brand, size, and placement details for your personal medical records. With thousands of successful breast augmentations performed annually, Thailand's track record in this procedure is supported by consistently high patient satisfaction and safety outcomes."

    paragraphs: [
      "A breast lift — medically known as mastopexy — is a surgical procedure that raises and reshapes sagging breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue. Factors such as ageing, pregnancy, breastfeeding, weight fluctuations, and gravity can cause the breasts to lose firmness and droop. Mastopexy restores a more youthful, uplifted breast contour and can also reduce the size of enlarged areolae.",
      "Thailand's board-certified plastic surgeons offer several breast lift techniques, each suited to different degrees of ptosis (sagging). The crescent lift involves a small incision along the top half of the areola and is suitable for minimal sagging. The periareolar or 'donut' lift uses a circular incision around the areola for mild ptosis. The vertical or 'lollipop' lift adds a vertical incision from the areola to the breast crease for moderate sagging. The anchor or inverted-T lift is used for significant ptosis and provides the most dramatic reshaping.",
      "During your consultation, your surgeon will assess the degree of sagging, skin elasticity, breast volume, and nipple position to determine the most appropriate technique. If you wish to increase breast volume simultaneously, implants can be placed during the same procedure — a combination known as augmentation mastopexy. Conversely, if your breasts are large and heavy, a breast lift can be combined with a reduction for both lifting and resizing.",
      "Mastopexy is performed under general anaesthesia and typically takes two to three hours. An overnight hospital stay is standard to ensure proper monitoring. You will be fitted with a surgical support bra immediately after the procedure, which should be worn continuously for four to six weeks. Drains may be placed temporarily to prevent fluid build-up and are usually removed within a few days.",
      "Initial recovery involves swelling, bruising, and some discomfort for the first one to two weeks, manageable with prescribed medication. Most patients return to office work within two weeks and can resume exercise after six weeks. Scars will fade gradually over 12 to 18 months and are strategically placed to be concealed by bras and swimwear. Your surgeon will recommend scar management products to optimise healing.",

      "Breast reduction surgery, or reduction mammaplasty, removes excess breast tissue, fat, and skin to achieve a breast size proportionate to your body. Overly large breasts can cause significant physical discomfort — including chronic back, neck, and shoulder pain, skin irritation beneath the breast crease, difficulty exercising, and breathing restrictions. Beyond physical relief, many patients experience a profound improvement in self-confidence and quality of life following breast reduction.",
      "Thailand's experienced plastic surgeons use advanced techniques to reduce breast volume while creating a natural, aesthetically pleasing breast shape. The most common approach is the anchor incision (inverted-T), which allows the surgeon to remove a significant amount of tissue and reposition the nipple–areola complex to a higher, more youthful location. For patients requiring moderate reduction, the vertical ('lollipop') technique may be used, resulting in less scarring.",
      "During consultation, your surgeon will assess your breast size, shape, skin quality, and nipple position, as well as discuss your lifestyle and goals. Measurements and photographs are taken to plan the surgery precisely. Your surgeon will also review your medical history, including any conditions that might affect healing, and explain the expected outcomes, limitations, and potential risks in detail.",
      "The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia and typically takes three to four hours. An overnight hospital stay is standard. Surgical drains may be placed temporarily to prevent fluid accumulation, and a supportive surgical bra is worn immediately after the procedure. Most patients report that the relief from back and neck pain is noticeable almost immediately after surgery.",
      "Recovery involves moderate swelling and bruising for the first two weeks. Sutures are typically removed after 10 to 14 days. Most patients return to desk work within two weeks and can resume full physical activity, including exercise, after six weeks. Scars will continue to mature and fade over 12 to 18 months, with scar management therapy recommended to optimise the cosmetic outcome.",

      "Liposuction is a body contouring procedure that removes stubborn, diet-resistant fat deposits from targeted areas of the body, including the abdomen, flanks (love handles), thighs, hips, upper arms, back, chin, and neck. It is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures performed globally, and Thailand's board-certified surgeons deliver outstanding results using the latest techniques in a world-class hospital setting.",
      "Several liposuction techniques are available in Thailand. Traditional tumescent liposuction involves injecting a saline-anaesthetic solution into the treatment area to minimise bleeding and facilitate smoother fat removal. Vaser liposuction uses ultrasound energy to emulsify fat cells before gentle suction, allowing for more precise body sculpting with less trauma to surrounding tissues. Power-assisted liposuction (PAL) uses a vibrating cannula to break up fat more efficiently. Your surgeon will recommend the technique best suited to your anatomy and goals.",
      "Ideal candidates for liposuction are adults within 30% of their ideal body weight who have good skin elasticity and localised fat deposits that have not responded to a healthy diet and regular exercise. It is important to understand that liposuction is a body contouring procedure — not a weight-loss solution. It is designed to refine and sculpt your silhouette by targeting specific problem areas.",
      "The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia or local anaesthesia with sedation, depending on the extent of treatment. Small incisions (typically 3–5mm) are made in inconspicuous locations, and a thin cannula is inserted to suction out the targeted fat. The duration varies from one to four hours depending on the number and size of areas treated. Many patients are discharged the same day or after one night of observation.",
      "Post-operative recovery requires wearing a compression garment over the treated areas for four to six weeks. This helps reduce swelling, supports skin retraction, and promotes smooth contouring. Swelling and bruising are most noticeable in the first two weeks and gradually subside over the following months. Most patients return to desk work within one week and resume full exercise after four to six weeks.",
      "Results become progressively more visible as swelling resolves, with the final outcome typically seen at three to six months. The fat cells removed by liposuction do not grow back; however, remaining fat cells in the treated area can enlarge with significant weight gain. Maintaining a stable weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise is essential for preserving your results long-term.",

While closely related to liposuction, lipoplasty often refers specifically to newer, precision-focused approaches such as power-assisted lipoplasty (PAL) and ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty that allow surgeons to achieve more refined results with reduced tissue trauma.",
      "Power-assisted lipoplasty uses a specialised cannula that produces rapid, small vibrations to break up fat cells before they are suctioned out. This mechanical assistance allows the surgeon to work with greater control and precision, particularly in fibrous areas such as the upper back, male chest, and areas with prior scarring. The result is smoother contouring, more even fat removal, and a faster recovery compared to traditional manual liposuction.",

Common treatment areas include the abdomen, flanks, inner and outer thighs, upper arms, chin, and neck. Multiple areas can often be treated in a single session.",

      "A tummy tuck, medically known as abdominoplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the abdomen while repairing separated or weakened abdominal muscles. This creates a smoother, firmer, and flatter abdominal profile. The procedure is especially popular among women who have had multiple pregnancies and individuals who have undergone significant weight loss, as diet and exercise alone cannot address stretched skin and muscle separation (diastasis recti).",
      "Thailand's plastic surgeons offer several abdominoplasty options tailored to the extent of correction required. A full tummy tuck involves a hip-to-hip incision just above the pubic area, through which excess skin and fat are removed, the abdominal muscles are tightened, and the belly button is repositioned. A mini tummy tuck uses a shorter incision and addresses only the area below the navel — ideal for patients with limited excess skin. An extended tummy tuck addresses the flanks and lower back in addition to the abdomen, suitable for patients with more extensive skin laxity.",
      "During your consultation, your surgeon will evaluate your abdominal skin quality, fat distribution, muscle tone, and overall health. Factors such as your body mass index, previous abdominal surgeries, and future pregnancy plans are all discussed. Computer imaging may be used to illustrate expected outcomes. Your surgeon will recommend the specific tummy tuck variation best suited to achieving your goals while minimising scarring.",
      "Abdominoplasty is performed under general anaesthesia and takes two to four hours depending on the extent of the procedure. A hospital stay of one to two nights is standard to ensure proper monitoring, pain management, and drain care. Surgical drains are typically placed to prevent fluid accumulation and are removed within three to seven days.",
      "Recovery from a tummy tuck is more involved than some cosmetic procedures. You will be asked to walk slightly bent at the waist for the first week to reduce tension on the incision. A compression garment is worn for six to eight weeks. Most patients return to desk work within two to three weeks. Light exercise can resume after six weeks, with full unrestricted activity at eight to twelve weeks. The incision scar fades significantly over 12 to 24 months and is positioned to be hidden beneath underwear and swimwear.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Cheek reduction surgery, also known as malar reduction or zygoma reduction, is a facial bone contouring procedure that reduces the prominence of wide or protruding cheekbones to create a slimmer, more refined facial profile. This procedure is popular among patients seeking a V-line facial shape — a facial contour characterised by a narrow lower face and elegant jawline — and is commonly performed alongside other facial contouring procedures such as jaw reduction and chin reshaping.",
      "Thailand's facial contouring surgeons are among the most experienced in Asia, having performed thousands of malar reduction procedures. The surgery is typically performed through incisions made inside the mouth (intraoral approach), leaving no visible external scars. The cheekbone is carefully fractured in a controlled manner and repositioned inward to reduce facial width. In some cases, a portion of the zygomatic arch is also addressed to achieve a more comprehensive slimming effect.",
      "During your consultation, your surgeon will evaluate your facial bone structure using clinical examination and imaging (such as CT scans) to plan the precise extent of bone reduction. Computer simulations may be used to help you visualise the expected outcome. The procedure is fully customised to your facial proportions to ensure a balanced, natural result.",
      "Cheek reduction is performed under general anaesthesia and takes approximately two to three hours. A hospital stay of one to two nights is standard. Post-operative swelling is significant and peaks during the first week, gradually subsiding over six to eight weeks. A compression bandage is worn around the face for the first week. Soft foods are recommended for the first two to three weeks to minimise stress on the surgical area.",
      "Final results become fully apparent after four to six months as all residual swelling resolves. The outcome is a slimmer, more harmonious facial contour that enhances overall facial balance. Patient satisfaction with cheek reduction in Thailand is high, reflecting both the surgical expertise available and the comprehensive care provided throughout the treatment journey.",
      "The cost of cheek reduction surgery in Thailand is 60–70% less than equivalent procedures in South Korea, the United States, or the United Kingdom, with all-inclusive packages covering the surgeon's fee, hospital stay, anaesthesia, imaging, and follow-up consultations."

      "Chin augmentation, or mentoplasty, is a surgical procedure that enhances the size and projection of the chin using a biocompatible implant or, in some cases, by repositioning the chin bone (sliding genioplasty). A well-proportioned chin is fundamental to facial harmony, and even subtle changes can dramatically improve your profile, balance your facial proportions, and enhance the appearance of your nose and jawline.",
      "Thailand's board-certified plastic surgeons offer chin augmentation using high-quality silicone implants available in various shapes (anatomical and extended) and sizes. During your consultation, your surgeon will analyse your facial proportions, photograph your profile, and may use digital imaging to illustrate the expected improvement. Chin augmentation is frequently combined with rhinoplasty — a combination known as profiloplasty — to achieve comprehensive facial balancing in a single surgical session.",

Both techniques result in minimal or hidden scarring. The implant is positioned on the front of the chin bone and secured in a pocket created by the surgeon. The procedure takes approximately one to two hours under general or local anaesthesia with sedation.",
      "Recovery from chin augmentation is relatively straightforward. Swelling and mild bruising subside within one to two weeks. A chin strap may be worn for the first week to support the implant position. Most patients return to normal activities within seven to ten days. The implant settles into its final position over four to six weeks, with the refined facial profile clearly visible at this stage.",

The result is a more refreshed, youthful, and alert appearance. As we age, the brow descends due to gravity and loss of skin elasticity, which can create a tired, angry, or sad expression — even when we feel the opposite. A brow lift addresses these concerns effectively and with long-lasting results.",
      "Thailand's board-certified plastic surgeons offer two primary brow lift techniques. The endoscopic brow lift uses several small incisions hidden within the hairline, through which a tiny camera and specialised instruments are inserted to lift and reposition the brow. This technique offers faster recovery, minimal scarring, and a natural result. The classic or coronal brow lift involves a longer incision across the top of the head from ear to ear, hidden within the hair. This approach allows for more significant lifting and is recommended for patients with deep forehead creases or substantial brow ptosis.",
      "During your consultation, your surgeon will assess the position of your brows, the depth of your forehead lines, skin quality, and overall facial ageing. A brow lift is often combined with upper eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) and/or a facelift for comprehensive facial rejuvenation, and your surgeon will advise on the combination that best addresses your concerns.",
      "The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia or sedation and takes one to two hours. Most patients are discharged the same day or after one night of observation. Initial swelling and bruising around the forehead and eyes resolve within two weeks. Sutures or staples are removed after seven to ten days. Most patients return to social activities within two weeks.",
      "Results from a brow lift are long-lasting, typically enduring seven to ten years or more.

It addresses the most visible signs of ageing — including sagging skin, deep nasolabial folds, jowls along the jawline, and loose neck skin — to restore a firmer, more youthful facial contour. Thailand has become one of the world's leading destinations for facelift surgery, offering the expertise of board-certified surgeons at internationally accredited hospitals for a fraction of Western costs.",
      "Modern facelift techniques have evolved significantly from the skin-only facelifts of the past. Today, Thailand's surgeons perform deep-plane and SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) facelifts that reposition the deeper facial tissues and muscles — not just the skin. This approach produces more natural-looking, longer-lasting results that avoid the 'windswept' or pulled appearance associated with older techniques.",
      "During the procedure, incisions are made along the hairline at the temples, continuing around the ear and into the lower scalp. Through these incisions, the surgeon lifts and repositions the underlying SMAS layer, removes or redistributes fat, and redrapes the skin for a smoother, more youthful appearance. A neck lift (platysmaplasty) is often performed simultaneously to address neck banding, double chin, and loose neck skin.",
      "A facelift is frequently combined with complementary procedures such as a brow lift, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), fat grafting (to restore lost facial volume), or skin resurfacing to address fine lines and skin texture. Your surgeon will discuss these options during your consultation and recommend a tailored plan to achieve the most comprehensive, harmonious result.",
      "The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia and typically takes three to five hours. A hospital stay of one to two nights is standard. Drains may be placed temporarily and are removed within one to two days. A compression bandage is worn around the head and face for the first week to minimise swelling and support healing.",
      "Recovery from a full facelift takes approximately two to three weeks before most patients feel comfortable in social settings. Bruising and swelling peak within the first week and progressively fade. Sutures are removed after seven to fourteen days. Strenuous activity should be avoided for six weeks. While the initial improvement is dramatic, results continue to refine over three to six months as residual swelling resolves. A well-performed facelift can turn back the clock by 10 to 15 years, with results lasting a decade or more.",

Techniques may include cartilage trimming, suturing to refine shape, grafting to add definition or support, and repositioning to adjust tip rotation and projection. The surgeon may use cartilage harvested from the nasal septum or ear to create structural grafts that support the desired tip shape long-term.",

Under-eye bags are often hereditary and worsen with age as the orbital septum (the membrane holding fat pads in place behind the eye) weakens, allowing fat to herniate forward. This creates the characteristic 'bags' that do not respond to sleep, topical creams, or lifestyle changes.",

      "Thailand has earned its reputation as the world's premier destination for sex reassignment surgery (SRS), also known as gender confirmation surgery or gender-affirming surgery. For more than three decades, Thai surgeons have been at the forefront of SRS techniques, performing thousands of procedures and achieving outcomes recognised internationally for their excellence. Patients travel from every continent to access Thailand's unique combination of surgical expertise, specialised facilities, and compassionate transgender healthcare.",
      "SRS in Thailand encompasses comprehensive surgical options for both male-to-female and female-to-male transitions. MTF procedures include penile inversion vaginoplasty, colon vaginoplasty, peritoneal vaginoplasty, breast augmentation, facial feminisation surgery, and body contouring. FTM procedures include chest masculinisation (top surgery), hysterectomy, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, and scrotal reconstruction. Your surgeon will work with you to develop a personalised surgical plan aligned with your goals and timeline.",
      "Thailand's specialised gender surgery hospitals maintain the highest standards of patient care, with multidisciplinary teams that include surgeons, anaesthesiologists, psychologists, endocrinologists, and dedicated patient coordinators. The care pathway typically begins with a thorough medical and psychological evaluation, followed by detailed surgical planning, the procedure itself, and comprehensive post-operative care including dilation training, wound care, and rehabilitation.",
      "Pre-operative requirements generally align with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care, including documentation of persistent gender dysphoria, appropriate hormone therapy history (where applicable), and psychological readiness assessments. Thailand's surgical teams are experienced in working with patients at various stages of their transition and can advise on the optimal timing and sequencing of procedures.",
      "The cost of SRS in Thailand is typically 50–70% less than equivalent surgery in the United States, United Kingdom, or Australia. All-inclusive packages cover surgical fees, hospital stay, anaesthesia, post-operative care, medications, and follow-up consultations. The significant cost savings, combined with Thailand's globally acclaimed surgical expertise and the warmth of Thai hospitality, make it the preferred choice for patients seeking this profoundly life-changing surgery.",
      "Recovery and follow-up vary depending on the specific procedures performed. Primary MTF surgery typically requires a three- to four-week stay in Thailand, while FTM top surgery may require two to three weeks. Your surgical team will provide detailed post-operative instructions and maintain communication beyond your stay to support long-term healing and satisfaction."
